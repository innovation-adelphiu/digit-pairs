# digit-pairs
A web-based app for the puzzle game Digit Pairs.

Goal: Fill in the ten squares with the digits 0-9 so that:

- The digits add up to the number on the right.
- Each digit from 0 to 9 is used exactly once.

How to play:

- Tap a box to select it, then tap a digit button to enter it in the selected box.
- Green borders mean the sum for that row is correct.
- Red borders mean the sum for that row is incorrect or a digit has already been used.
- Tap Hints to see which digit pairs add up to the number on the right. Hint pairs are grayed out once a digit has been used.
